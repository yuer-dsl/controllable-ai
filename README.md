# controllable-ai
Normative specification, governance position statements, and case-based interpretations for Controllable AI systems.

## Normative Specification & Governance Anchor

This repository defines the **normative specification, governance positioning, and structural interpretation**
of **Controllable AI**.

Controllable AI is **not** an AI model, framework, operating system, or product.
It is a **structural legality requirement** that determines whether an AI-assisted
decision is **permitted to occur at execution time**.

This repository serves as the **root governance and specification anchor**
for the Controllable AI system.

## What Controllable AI Is

**Controllable AI** is a system-level property, not a measure of intelligence.

A system is considered *Controllable* if and only if:

- AI never holds final decision authority
- Responsibility remains explicitly and exclusively human
- Decisions are deterministic, replayable, and auditable
- A non-AI, non-bypassable veto authority exists at execution time

Controllable AI does **not** decide what should be done.
It decides **whether an AI-assisted action is allowed to happen**.
